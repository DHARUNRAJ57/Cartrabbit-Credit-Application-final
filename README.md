# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation#installation)

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/DHARUNRAJ57/Cartrabbit-Credit-Application-final.git
Switch to the repo folder

    cd Cartrabbit-Credit-Application-final

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env
    Start XAMPP:
Open XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

Access phpMyAdmin:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin or click on the "Admin" button for MySQL in the XAMPP Control Panel. This will open the phpMyAdmin interface.

Create the Database:
Once in phpMyAdmin:

Click on the "Databases" tab.
In the "Create database" field, enter mirc04.
Choose the collation if needed (default is usually fine).
Click on the "Create" button to create the mirc04 database.
Verification:
After creating the database, you can verify its creation by checking the list of databases in phpMyAdmin. You should see mirc04 listed among the databases.

To guide users through these steps in a README file, you can include instructions similar to the following Markdown:

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Generate a new JWT authentication secret key

    php artisan jwt:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

**TL;DR command list**

    git clone git@github.com:gothinkster/laravel-realworld-example-app.git
    cd laravel-realworld-example-app
    composer install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan jwt:generate 
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DummyDataSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DummyDataSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
    
## Docker

To install with [Docker](https://www.docker.com), run following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:gothinkster/laravel-realworld-example-app.git
cd laravel-realworld-example-app
cp .env.example.docker .env
docker run -v $(pwd):/app composer install
cd ./docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec php php artisan key:generate
docker-compose exec php php artisan jwt:generate
docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec php php artisan db:seed
docker-compose exec php php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0
```

The api can be accessed at [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api).

## API Specification

This application adheres to the api specifications set by the [Thinkster](https://github.com/gothinkster) team. This helps mix and match any backend with any other frontend without conflicts.
